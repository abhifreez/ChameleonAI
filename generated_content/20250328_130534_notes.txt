OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING (OOP) IN JAVA
========================================================

These notes provide a comprehensive introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java. We'll explore core concepts, practical applications, and interactive exercises to solidify your understanding. By the end, you'll be equipped to design and implement robust, maintainable Java applications using OOP principles.

-- Introduction --

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm centered around the concept of "objects," which contain data (attributes) and code (methods) to manipulate that data. Java is an object-oriented language, meaning that virtually everything in Java is an object. OOP provides a powerful way to structure software, promoting code reusability, maintainability, and scalability.

-- Learning Objectives --

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. DEFINE the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
2. EXPLAIN how these principles are implemented in Java.
3. CREATE Java classes and objects.
4. IMPLEMENT inheritance hierarchies using `extends`.
5. OVERRIDE methods to achieve polymorphism.
6. APPLY encapsulation using access modifiers (public, private, protected).
7. DESIGN and IMPLEMENT simple Java programs using OOP principles.
8. DIFFERENTIATE between the various OOP concepts and apply them appropriately.

-- Conceptual Breakdown --

OOP revolves around these key concepts:

* ENCAPSULATION: Bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on that data within a single unit, called a class.  Think of it like a capsule - it contains everything it needs.

* INHERITANCE:  Allows you to create new classes (child or subclasses) that inherit attributes and methods from existing classes (parent or superclasses).  This promotes code reuse and establishes "is-a" relationships.

* POLYMORPHISM:  The ability of an object to take on many forms.  This is achieved through method overriding (same method name, different implementation in subclasses) and method overloading (same method name, different parameters).

* ABSTRACTION:  Focusing on the essential characteristics of an object while ignoring irrelevant details.  This simplifies complexity and allows you to work with objects at a higher level of abstraction.  Abstract classes and interfaces are key tools for abstraction in Java.

-- Comprehensive Content Structure --

= 1. Classes and Objects =

-- 1.1 What is a Class? --

A CLASS is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the attributes (data) and methods (behavior) that objects of that class will possess.

EXAMPLE:

```java
public class Dog {
    // Attributes (variables)
    String breed;
    String name;
    int age;

    // Methods (functions)
    public void bark() {
        System.out.println("Woof!");
    }

    public void displayInfo() {
        System.out.println("Breed: " + breed + ", Name: " + name + ", Age: " + age);
    }
}
```

-- 1.2 What is an Object? --

An OBJECT is an instance of a class.  You create objects from classes.

EXAMPLE:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a Dog object
        Dog myDog = new Dog();

        // Set attributes
        myDog.breed = "Golden Retriever";
        myDog.name = "Buddy";
        myDog.age = 3;

        // Call methods
        myDog.bark(); // Output: Woof!
        myDog.displayInfo(); // Output: Breed: Golden Retriever, Name: Buddy, Age: 3
    }
}
```

-- 1.3 Creating Objects --

The `new` keyword is used to create new objects.  The constructor (a special method with the same name as the class) is called to initialize the object.

EXAMPLE:

```java
Dog anotherDog = new Dog(); // Calls the default (no-argument) constructor
```

= 2. Encapsulation =

-- 2.1 The Need for Encapsulation --

Encapsulation helps to protect data from unauthorized access and modification.  It promotes data integrity and reduces the risk of unintended side effects.

-- 2.2 Access Modifiers --

Java provides access modifiers to control the visibility of class members (attributes and methods):

* `public`: Accessible from anywhere.
* `private`: Accessible only within the same class.
* `protected`: Accessible within the same class, subclasses, and classes within the same package.
* (default - package-private): Accessible within the same package.

-- 2.3 Implementing Encapsulation --

Typically, attributes are declared `private`, and access to them is provided through `public` getter and setter methods.

EXAMPLE:

```java
public class Dog {
    private String breed;
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public String getBreed() {
        return breed;
    }

    public void setBreed(String breed) {
        this.breed = breed;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    public void setAge(int age) {
        if (age >= 0) { // Validation
            this.age = age;
        } else {
            System.out.println("Invalid age.");
        }
    }

    public void displayInfo() {
        System.out.println("Breed: " + breed + ", Name: " + name + ", Age: " + age);
    }
}
```

= 3. Inheritance =

-- 3.1 The `extends` Keyword --

Inheritance allows you to create a new class (subclass) that inherits from an existing class (superclass).  The `extends` keyword is used to specify the inheritance relationship.

EXAMPLE:

```java
class Animal {
    String name;

    void eat() {
        System.out.println("Animal is eating.");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    String breed;

    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Woof!");
    }
}
```

-- 3.2 Superclass and Subclass --

The superclass (parent class) provides the basic attributes and methods, while the subclass (child class) inherits and extends these.

-- 3.3 Method Overriding --

A subclass can override a method inherited from its superclass to provide a specialized implementation.  Use the `@Override` annotation to ensure you are actually overriding a method.

EXAMPLE:

```java
class Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Generic animal sound.");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Woof!"); // Overrides the makeSound method
    }
}
```

= 4. Polymorphism =

-- 4.1 Method Overloading --

Method overloading occurs when a class has multiple methods with the same name but different parameters (different number or types of arguments).

EXAMPLE:

```java
class Calculator {
    int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

-- 4.2 Method Overriding (Review) --

As discussed in the Inheritance section, method overriding is a key mechanism for polymorphism.

-- 4.3 Dynamic Binding --

Polymorphism allows you to treat objects of different classes in a uniform way.  At runtime, the appropriate method is called based on the actual type of the object.

EXAMPLE:

```java
Animal myAnimal = new Dog(); // Polymorphism!
myAnimal.makeSound(); // Output: Woof! (because myAnimal is actually a Dog object)
```

= 5. Abstraction =

-- 5.1 Abstract Classes --

An abstract class cannot be instantiated (you cannot create objects directly from it). It serves as a blueprint for subclasses. Abstract classes can contain abstract methods (methods without an implementation).

EXAMPLE:

```java
abstract class Shape {
    abstract double getArea(); // Abstract method

    void display() {
        System.out.println("This is a shape.");
    }
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    double radius;

    @Override
    double getArea() {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }
}
```

-- 5.2 Interfaces --

An interface is a completely abstract type.  It contains only abstract methods (and constant fields, which are less common).  A class can implement multiple interfaces.  Use the `implements` keyword.

EXAMPLE:

```java
interface Drawable {
    void draw();
}

class Rectangle implements Drawable {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a rectangle.");
    }
}
```

   ```

-- Practical Application --

* **Case Study: Banking System**

   Consider a banking system where you have `Account` as a base class. Subclasses could be `SavingsAccount` and `CheckingAccount`.  `Account` could have abstract methods like `deposit()` and `withdraw()`, which are then implemented differently in the subclasses based on their specific rules (e.g., interest rates, transaction limits).  Encapsulation would be used to protect account balances.

* **Industry-Relevant Scenario: E-commerce Platform**

   Think about an e-commerce platform. You might have a `Product` class. Subclasses could be `Book`, `Electronics`, and `Clothing`.  Each subclass would have its own specific attributes (e.g., author for `Book`, screen size for `Electronics`).  Polymorphism could be used to display product information in a consistent way, regardless of the product type.

2.  **Coding Challenge:**

    Create a `Vehicle` class with attributes like `speed` and `color`, and a method called `accelerate()`.  Then, create a `Car` class that inherits from `Vehicle` and overrides the `accelerate()` method to increase the speed by a larger amount.

3.  **Analytical Problem-Solving Task:**

    Explain how encapsulation can improve the security of a software application.
