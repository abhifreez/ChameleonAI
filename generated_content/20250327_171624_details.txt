OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING (OOP) IN JAVA
=======================================================

WELCOME! This module will guide you through the fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java. We will break down complex ideas into digestible pieces, providing real-world examples and interactive exercises to solidify your understanding. By the end, you'll be equipped to apply OOP principles in your own Java projects. PREPARE TO HAVE THE "AHA!" MOMENT!

**LEARNING OBJECTIVES**

* UNDERSTAND the core principles of OOP: Objects, Classes, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction.
* DIFFERENTIATE between classes and objects and model real-world entities using them.
* APPLY encapsulation to protect data within classes.
* IMPLEMENT inheritance to create reusable and organized class hierarchies.
* UTILIZE polymorphism to write flexible and adaptable code.
* EMPLOY abstraction to simplify complex systems and improve code maintainability.
* RECOGNIZE the benefits of OOP for software development.
* TRANSLATE theoretical concepts into practical Java code.

**WHY IS OOP IMPORTANT?**

OOP provides a powerful paradigm for designing and developing software. It promotes modularity, reusability, and maintainability, leading to more robust and scalable applications. Mastering OOP is crucial for any aspiring Java developer.

= Objects and Classes =

-- Definition of a Class --

A CLASS is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the attributes (data) and behaviors (methods) that objects of that class will possess. Think of it like a cookie cutter – the cutter is the class, and the cookies are the objects.

* It is a logical entity.
* It doesn't occupy memory space until an object is created.
* It defines the type of object.

-- Definition of an Object --

An OBJECT is an instance of a class. It is a concrete entity that occupies memory space and has specific values for the attributes defined by its class. Each object is independent and can interact with other objects. Think of the cookie!

* It is a real-world entity (e.g., car, dog, person).
* It occupies memory space.
* It has state (attributes) and behavior (methods).

-- Real-time Example: Car Class and Object --

CLASS: Car
* Attributes: color, model, year, speed
* Methods: accelerate(), brake(), turnOnEngine(), turnOffEngine()

OBJECT: myCar (an instance of the Car class)
* color: "Red"
* model: "Tesla Model 3"
* year: 2023
* speed: 0

+---------------------+      +---------------------+
| - color: String     |      | - color: "Red"      |
| - model: String     |      | - model: "Tesla M3" |
| - year: int         |      | - year: 2023        |

JAVA CODE EXAMPLE:

```java
public class Car {
    String color;
    String model;
    int year;
    int speed;

    public void accelerate() {
        speed += 10;
        System.out.println("Accelerating! Speed: " + speed);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car myCar = new Car();
        myCar.color = "Red";
        myCar.model = "Tesla Model 3";
        myCar.year = 2023;
        myCar.speed = 0;

        myCar.accelerate(); // Output: Accelerating! Speed: 10
    }
}
```

c) They are the same thing.
d) Classes occupy memory, but objects do not.

(Answer: a)

= Encapsulation =

-- Definition: Bundling data and methods, restricting access --

ENCAPSULATION is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (behavior) that operate on that data within a single unit (class). It also involves restricting direct access to the data from outside the class, often using access modifiers like `private`. Think of it as a capsule that contains and protects its contents.

-- Purpose: Data hiding and protection --

* Data hiding: Prevents direct access to internal data.
* Data protection: Ensures data integrity by controlling how it's modified.
* Improves code maintainability: Changes to internal data don't affect external code.

-- Real-time Example: BankAccount Class --

CLASS: BankAccount
* Attributes: private accountBalance
* Methods: deposit(), withdraw(), getBalance() (notice the `private` attribute)

The `accountBalance` is made private, so it can only be accessed and modified using the `deposit()`, `withdraw()`, and `getBalance()` methods. This protects the balance from being directly manipulated from outside the class, ensuring that the rules for depositing and withdrawing are always followed.

VISUAL AID:

```
+-----------------------+
|  BankAccount Class   |
+-----------------------+
| - private balance    |   <-- Only accessible within the class
| + deposit(amount)     |
| + withdraw(amount)    |
| + getBalance()        |
+-----------------------+
  |
  | Deposit/Withdraw using public methods
  V
+-----------------------+
|   External Code      |
+-----------------------+
```

JAVA CODE EXAMPLE:

```java
public class BankAccount {
    private double accountBalance;

    public BankAccount(double initialBalance) {
        this.accountBalance = initialBalance;
    }

    public void deposit(double amount) {
        accountBalance += amount;
    }

    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        if (amount <= accountBalance) {
            accountBalance -= amount;
        } else {
            System.out.println("Insufficient funds!");
        }
    }

    public double getBalance() {
        return accountBalance;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BankAccount myAccount = new BankAccount(1000);
        myAccount.deposit(500);
        myAccount.withdraw(200);
        System.out.println("Account Balance: " + myAccount.getBalance()); // Output: Account Balance: 1300.0
    }
}
```

**INTERACTIVE LEARNING ELEMENT:**

Coding Challenge:

Modify the `BankAccount` class to include a `setBalance()` method.  Explain why this method might be a bad idea from an encapsulation perspective.

(Hint: Think about how setting the balance directly bypasses the controlled mechanisms of deposit and withdraw.)

= Inheritance =

-- Definition: Subclass inheriting from superclass --

INHERITANCE is a mechanism where a new class (subclass or derived class) inherits properties and behaviors from an existing class (superclass or base class). It promotes code reusability and creates a hierarchical relationship between classes. Think of it like a family tree – children inherit traits from their parents.

-- Types: Single, multiple, multilevel, hierarchical, hybrid (Java supports single inheritance) --

* SINGLE: A subclass inherits from only one superclass. (Java's approach)
* MULTIPLE: A subclass inherits from multiple superclasses. (Not directly supported in Java - interfaces are used instead).
* MULTILEVEL: A subclass inherits from another subclass, which inherits from a superclass (A -> B -> C).
* HIERARCHICAL: Multiple subclasses inherit from a single superclass.
* HYBRID: A combination of multiple inheritance types (not directly supported in Java).

-- Real-time Example: Animal and Dog Classes --

CLASS: Animal (Superclass)
* Attributes: name, age
* Methods: eat(), sleep()

CLASS: Dog (Subclass, inherits from Animal)
* Attributes: breed (in addition to name and age)
* Methods: bark() (in addition to eat() and sleep())

The `Dog` class inherits the `name`, `age`, `eat()`, and `sleep()` properties from the `Animal` class.  It then adds its own specific attribute (`breed`) and behavior (`bark()`).

VISUAL AID:

```
+-----------------+      +-----------------+
|   Animal Class  |----->|    Dog Class    |
+-----------------+      +-----------------+
| - name: String  |      | - breed: String |
| - age: int     |      |  (Inherited)     |
| + eat()         |      | + bark()        |
| + sleep()       |      | + eat()         |
+-----------------+      | + sleep()       |
                        +-----------------+
```

JAVA CODE EXAMPLE:

```java
class Animal {
    String name;
    int age;

    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("Animal is eating.");
    }

    public void sleep() {
        System.out.println("Animal is sleeping.");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    String breed;

    public void bark() {
        System.out.println("Dog is barking.");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog myDog = new Dog();
        myDog.name = "Buddy";
        myDog.age = 3;
        myDog.breed = "Golden Retriever";

        myDog.eat();   // Output: Animal is eating.
        myDog.bark();  // Output: Dog is barking.
    }
}
```

Analytical Problem-Solving Task:

Imagine you are designing a system for managing different types of vehicles (Car, Truck, Motorcycle).  How would you use inheritance to model these relationships? Create a class diagram showing the superclass and subclasses.

= Polymorphism =

-- Definition: Object taking on many forms --

POLYMORPHISM means "many forms." In OOP, it refers to the ability of an object to take on many forms. This is achieved through method overloading and method overriding. It allows you to write code that can work with objects of different classes in a uniform way.

-- Types: Compile-time (Method Overloading), Run-time (Method Overriding) --

* METHOD OVERLOADING (Compile-time/Static Polymorphism):  Defining multiple methods in the same class with the same name but different parameters (different number, types, or order of parameters). The compiler decides which method to call based on the arguments passed.
* METHOD OVERRIDING (Run-time/Dynamic Polymorphism):  A subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. The method signature (name and parameters) must be the same.  The JVM decides which method to call at runtime based on the actual object type.

-- Real-time Example: Method Overloading and Overriding with Animal and Dog Classes --

METHOD OVERLOADING:  Imagine an `Animal` class with multiple `eat()` methods:

```java
public class Animal {
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("Animal is eating.");
    }

    public void eat(String food) {
        System.out.println("Animal is eating " + food);
    }
}
```

METHOD OVERRIDING: Imagine a `Dog` class overriding the `eat()` method from the `Animal` class:

```java
public class Animal {
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("Animal is eating.");
    }
}

public class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override //Good practice to use @Override annotation
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("Dog is eating a bone.");
    }
}
```

When you call `eat()` on an `Animal` object, it prints "Animal is eating." When you call `eat()` on a `Dog` object, it prints "Dog is eating a bone."

VISUAL AID (Method Overriding):

```
+-----------------+      +-----------------+
|   Animal Class  |      |    Dog Class    |
+-----------------+      +-----------------+
| + eat()         |      | + eat() (OVERRIDDEN)|
+-----------------+      +-----------------+
       |                     ^
       |                     |
       -----------------------
           Runtime determines
           which eat() to call
```

JAVA CODE EXAMPLE:

```java
class Animal {
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("Animal is eating.");
    }

    public void eat(String food) {
        System.out.println("Animal is eating " + food);
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("Dog is eating a bone.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal myAnimal = new Animal();
        Dog myDog = new Dog();

        myAnimal.eat();          // Output: Animal is eating.
        myAnimal.eat("grass");   // Output: Animal is eating grass
        myDog.eat();             // Output: Dog is eating a bone.  (Overridden method)
    }
}
```

Multiple-Choice Question:

Which type of polymorphism is resolved at compile time?

a) Method Overriding
b) Method Overloading
c) Dynamic Polymorphism
d) Both a and c

(Answer: b)

= Abstraction =

-- Definition: Hiding implementation details, showing essential information --

ABSTRACTION is the process of hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the essential information to the user. It simplifies complex systems by focusing on what an object does rather than how it does it. Think of it like driving a car – you don't need to know the intricate details of the engine to drive it.

-- Achieved through: Abstract classes and interfaces --

* ABSTRACT CLASSES: A class that cannot be instantiated directly. It may contain abstract methods (methods without implementation) that must be implemented by its subclasses.
* INTERFACES: A completely abstract "class" that contains only abstract methods (and constants). A class can implement multiple interfaces.

-- Real-time Example: Remote Control, Shape Interface and Circle Class --

REMOTE CONTROL: You use a remote control to operate a TV without needing to know the internal circuitry or how signals are processed. The remote control provides an abstract interface.

SHAPE INTERFACE: Define a shape interface. Concrete classes, like Circle or Square, implement the shape interface by providing specific details.

VISUAL AID:

```
+--------------------+        +--------------------+
|   Shape Interface  |------->|   Circle Class   |
+--------------------+        +--------------------+
| + getArea()         |        | + getArea()        |
| + getPerimeter()    |        | + getPerimeter()   |
+--------------------+        +--------------------+
       ^
       | Implements
       |
+--------------------+
|   Square Class     |
+--------------------+
| + getArea()         |
| + getPerimeter()    |
+--------------------+
```

JAVA CODE EXAMPLE:

```java
interface Shape {
    double getArea();
    double getPerimeter();
}

class Circle implements Shape {
    double radius;

    public Circle(double radius) {
        this.radius = radius;
    }

    @Override
    public double getArea() {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }

    @Override
    public double getPerimeter() {
        return 2 * Math.PI * radius;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Circle myCircle = new Circle(5);
        System.out.println("Circle Area: " + myCircle.getArea());
        System.out.println("Circle Perimeter: " + myCircle.getPerimeter());
    }
}
```

* Encapsulation protects our data, inheritance enables code reuse, polymorphism allows for flexibility, and abstraction simplifies complex systems.

-- Link Concepts Together for Holistic Understanding --

OOP principles work together to create well-structured, maintainable, and scalable software. Encapsulation enables data protection. Inheritance builds upon existing functionality while defining newer, more specialized classes. Polymorphism enhances the flexibility. Abstraction allows designers to focus on what is important. When these are carefully applied, powerful solutions appear.
