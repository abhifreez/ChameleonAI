OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING (OOP) IN JAVA
==========================================================

Welcome to the world of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java! This set of notes will guide you through the core principles, concepts, and practical applications of OOP, specifically tailored for Java development. We'll break down complex ideas into digestible pieces, ensuring a clear understanding, regardless of your prior experience. By the end of this journey, you'll be equipped to design and build robust, maintainable, and scalable Java applications using the power of OOP.

-- Introduction to OOP --

What is OOP, and why should you care? OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which contain data (fields, attributes) and code (methods, procedures) to manipulate that data. It’s a powerful way to organize and structure your code, making it easier to understand, modify, and reuse.

- WHY OOP?
   * Code Reusability: Write once, use many times.
   * Modularity: Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts.
   * Data Encapsulation: Protect data from accidental modification.
   * Abstraction: Hide complex implementation details, exposing only essential information.
   * Polymorphism: Treat objects of different classes in a uniform way.
   * Maintainability: Easier to understand, debug, and update.

-- Learning Objectives --

After completing this module, you will be able to:

1.  DEFINE the four core principles of OOP (Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism).
2.  EXPLAIN the concepts of classes and objects in Java.
3.  IMPLEMENT classes with appropriate attributes and methods in Java.
4.  APPLY inheritance and polymorphism to create flexible and extensible Java applications.
5.  DESIGN and DEVELOP object-oriented solutions to real-world problems using Java.

-- Conceptual Breakdown --

OOP revolves around several key concepts:

1.  CLASSES and OBJECTS

    --What is a Class?--

    A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects.  It defines the attributes (data) and methods (behavior) that objects of that class will have. Think of it as a cookie cutter: the cutter is the class, and the cookies are the objects.

    --What is an Object?--

    An object is an instance of a class.  It’s a concrete entity that exists in memory and has its own unique set of data values for the attributes defined in its class.  Each cookie you cut from the cutter is a unique object, even though they all share the same shape.

    EXAMPLE:

    Consider a `Dog` class. The `Dog` class might have attributes like `breed`, `name`, `age`, and methods like `bark()`, `eat()`, `sleep()`.  An object would be a specific dog, like "Buddy," a Golden Retriever who is 3 years old.

     +-------------+      +-------------+
     |    Class    |----->|    Object   |
     |   (Blueprint)|      | (Instance)  |
     +-------------+      +-------------+
           Dog                 Buddy (a Dog)

2.  ENCAPSULATION

    Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit (a class).  It also involves controlling access to the data, often using access modifiers like `private`, `protected`, and `public`. This protects data from unintended modification and ensures data integrity.

    Think of it like a capsule containing medicine.  The medicine (data) is protected within the capsule, and you can only access it in a controlled way (through methods).

    WHY IS ENCAPSULATION IMPORTANT?
    *  Data hiding: Prevents direct access to the internal state of an object.
    *  Data integrity: Ensures that data is modified only through controlled methods.
    *  Modularity: Makes it easier to understand and maintain code.

3.  ABSTRACTION

    Abstraction is the process of hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the essential information to the user.  It allows you to focus on what an object *does* rather than *how* it does it.

    Think of driving a car.  You need to know how to accelerate, brake, and steer, but you don't need to understand the inner workings of the engine.  The car abstracts away the complexity of the engine and provides a simple interface for the driver.

    ABSTRACT CLASSES and INTERFACES are key tools for achieving abstraction in Java.

4.  INHERITANCE

    Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class (a subclass or derived class) to inherit properties (attributes and methods) from another class (a superclass or base class).  This promotes code reuse and allows you to create a hierarchy of classes.

    Think of it as inheriting traits from your parents.  You inherit certain characteristics from your mother and father.  Similarly, a subclass inherits characteristics from its superclass.

    EXAMPLE:
     `Animal` (Superclass) -> `Dog` (Subclass).  The `Dog` class inherits attributes like `name` and `age` from the `Animal` class, but can also have its own specific attributes like `breed` and methods like `fetch()`.

5.  POLYMORPHISM

    Polymorphism means "many forms."  In OOP, it refers to the ability of an object to take on many forms. This is typically achieved through inheritance and interfaces.  A single method call can behave differently depending on the type of object it's called on.

    There are two main types of polymorphism in Java:

    *   Compile-time polymorphism (Method Overloading): Having multiple methods with the same name but different parameters within the same class.

    *   Runtime polymorphism (Method Overriding): A subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass.

    EXAMPLE:  The `Animal` class might have a method called `makeSound()`.  The `Dog` class overrides this method to `bark()`, while the `Cat` class overrides it to `meow()`. When you call `makeSound()` on an `Animal` object, the actual sound depends on whether the object is a `Dog` or a `Cat`.

-- Practical Application --

Let's consider a real-world case study: a library management system.

*   CLASSES: `Book`, `Member`, `Library`, `Loan`
*   ATTRIBUTES:
    *   `Book`: `title`, `author`, `ISBN`, `isBorrowed`
    *   `Member`: `memberID`, `name`, `address`, `borrowedBooks`
    *   `Library`: `books`, `members`
    *   `Loan`: `book`, `member`, `loanDate`, `dueDate`
*   METHODS:
    *   `Book`: `borrowBook()`, `returnBook()`
    *   `Member`: `borrowBook()`, `returnBook()`, `searchBook()`
    *   `Library`: `addBook()`, `removeBook()`, `registerMember()`, `lendBook()`, `returnBook()`

This system demonstrates the core OOP principles:

*   Encapsulation:  Each class encapsulates its data and methods.  For instance, the `Book` class manages its own borrowing status.
*   Abstraction: The `Library` class provides a simplified interface for members to interact with the library (borrowing, returning, searching for books) without needing to know the internal details of how the library is managed.
*   Inheritance (Possible extension): You could create subclasses of `Book` like `FictionBook` and `NonFictionBook` with specific attributes.
*   Polymorphism (Possible extension): A `search()` method in `Library` could accept different search criteria (title, author, ISBN) and return results accordingly.

EXAMPLE JAVA CODE SNIPPET (Conceptual):

```java
public class Book {
    private String title;
    private String author;
    private String ISBN;
    private boolean isBorrowed;

    public Book(String title, String author, String ISBN) {
        this.title = title;
        this.author = author;
        this.ISBN = ISBN;
        this.isBorrowed = false; // initially not borrowed
    }

    public void borrowBook() {
        if (!isBorrowed) {
            isBorrowed = true;
            System.out.println("Book borrowed: " + title);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Book is already borrowed.");
        }
    }

    public void returnBook() {
        isBorrowed = false;
        System.out.println("Book returned: " + title);
    }

    // Getters and setters for attributes (encapsulation)
    public String getTitle() { return title; }
    public String getAuthor() { return author; }
    public String getISBN() { return ISBN; }
    public boolean isBorrowed() { return isBorrowed; }
}

public class Member {
    private int memberID;
    private String name;
    // other attributes

    public void borrowBook(Book book) {
      book.borrowBook(); //Using the borrowBook method from the book class.
    }
    public void returnBook(Book book){
      book.returnBook();
    }
}

public class Library {
  public void lendBook(Book book, Member member){
    member.borrowBook(book);
  }
}
```
