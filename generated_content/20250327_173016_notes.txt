OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING (OOP) IN JAVA
=================================================

WELCOME! This guide provides a comprehensive overview of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java. We'll break down complex concepts into easy-to-understand explanations, supplemented with examples and interactive exercises. Get ready to say, "I finally get thisâ€”this makes sense now!"

**Learning Objectives:**

*   Understand the core principles of OOP: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction.
*   Define classes and create objects in Java.
*   Implement data hiding using access modifiers.
*   Apply inheritance to create reusable code.
*   Utilize polymorphism through method overloading and overriding.
*   Design abstract classes and interfaces.
*   Apply OOP principles to solve real-world problems.

= 1. Objects and Classes =

-- 1.1. Class as a Blueprint --

THINK OF A CLASS AS A BLUEPRINT FOR CREATING OBJECTS. It defines the properties (data) and behaviors (methods) that objects of that class will have.

-- 1.2. Object as an Instance of a Class --

AN OBJECT IS A SPECIFIC INSTANCE OF A CLASS.  For example, if "Car" is a class, then "myRedCar" is an object of the "Car" class.  It possesses the characteristics defined in the Car blueprint, but with specific values (e.g., color=red, model=Sedan).

-- 1.3. Attributes (Data) and Methods (Behavior) --

*   ATTRIBUTES (DATA):  These are the variables that hold the state of an object. In the "Car" class, attributes might be `color`, `model`, `speed`, and `fuelLevel`.

*   METHODS (BEHAVIOR): These are the functions that define what an object can do.  In the "Car" class, methods might be `accelerate()`, `brake()`, `refuel()`, and `getSpeed()`.

-- 1.4. Creating Objects in Java --

To create an object in Java, we use the `new` keyword:

```java
public class Car {
    String color;
    String model;

    public Car(String color, String model) {
        this.color = color;
        this.model = model;
    }

    public void accelerate() {
        System.out.println("The " + color + " " + model + " is accelerating!");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car myCar = new Car("Red", "Sedan"); // Creating a Car object
        myCar.accelerate(); // Calling a method on the object
    }
}
```

OUTPUT:

```
The Red Sedan is accelerating!
```

*KEY TAKEAWAY:* Classes are blueprints, objects are instances, attributes store data, and methods define behavior.

= 2. Encapsulation =

-- 2.1. Bundling Data and Methods --

ENCAPSULATION IS THE MECHANISM OF BUNDLING DATA (ATTRIBUTES) AND THE METHODS THAT OPERATE ON THAT DATA INTO A SINGLE UNIT, A CLASS. Think of it as a protective capsule around the object's internal workings.

-- 2.2. Access Modifiers (private, protected, public) --

ACCESS MODIFIERS CONTROL THE VISIBILITY OF CLASS MEMBERS (ATTRIBUTES AND METHODS).

*   `PRIVATE`: Accessible only within the same class. This provides the highest level of data hiding.
*   `PROTECTED`: Accessible within the same class, subclasses, and classes within the same package.
*   `PUBLIC`: Accessible from anywhere.

-- 2.3. Data Hiding and Data Integrity --

ENCAPSULATION ENABLES DATA HIDING. By making attributes `private`, you prevent direct access from outside the class.  This ensures data integrity, as the class can control how its data is modified through its methods.

-- 2.4. Getters and Setters --

GETTER METHODS (e.g., `getColor()`) allow you to retrieve the value of a private attribute. SETTER METHODS (e.g., `setColor()`) allow you to modify the value of a private attribute, often with validation logic to maintain data integrity.

```java
public class Car {
    private String color; // Private attribute

    public String getColor() { // Getter method
        return color;
    }

    public void setColor(String color) { // Setter method
        if (color.equals("Pink")) {
            System.out.println("Pink is not allowed");
        } else {
            this.color = color;
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car myCar = new Car();
        myCar.setColor("Blue");
        System.out.println("Car color: " + myCar.getColor());
        myCar.setColor("Pink");
    }

    public Car() {

    }
}
```

OUTPUT:

```
Car color: Blue
Pink is not allowed
```

*KEY TAKEAWAY:* Encapsulation protects data and provides controlled access through getters and setters.

= 3. Inheritance =

-- 3.1. Superclass (Base Class) and Subclass (Derived Class) --

INHERITANCE IS A MECHANISM WHERE A NEW CLASS (SUBCLASS/DERIVED CLASS) INHERITS PROPERTIES AND METHODS FROM AN EXISTING CLASS (SUPERCLASS/BASE CLASS).  The subclass extends the functionality of the superclass.

-- 3.2. Code Reusability --

INHERITANCE PROMOTES CODE REUSABILITY.  Instead of rewriting code, you can inherit existing code from a superclass and add or modify the necessary functionality in the subclass.

-- 3.3. "is-a" Relationship --

INHERITANCE ESTABLISHES AN "IS-A" RELATIONSHIP.  For example, a "SportsCar" *is-a* "Car".  A SportsCar inherits all the properties and methods of a Car but may also have its own unique characteristics (e.g., turbo boost).

-- 3.4. Single vs. Multiple Inheritance --

JAVA SUPPORTS SINGLE INHERITANCE, meaning a class can only inherit from one superclass directly.  However, Java supports *multiple inheritance of interface types* (covered in the Abstraction section).

```java
class Vehicle { // Superclass
    String modelName;

    public void startEngine() {
        System.out.println("Engine Started!");
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle { // Subclass inheriting from Vehicle
    public void drive() {
        System.out.println("Driving the " + modelName);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car myCar = new Car();
        myCar.modelName = "BMW";
        myCar.startEngine(); // Inherited method
        myCar.drive(); // Method specific to Car
    }
}
```

OUTPUT:

```
Engine Started!
Driving the BMW
```

*KEY TAKEAWAY:* Inheritance allows code reuse and establishes "is-a" relationships between classes. Java supports single inheritance of classes.

= 4. Polymorphism =

POLYMORPHISM MEANS "MANY FORMS."  It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common type.

-- 4.1. Method Overriding (Runtime Polymorphism) --

METHOD OVERRIDING OCCURS WHEN A SUBCLASS PROVIDES A SPECIFIC IMPLEMENTATION FOR A METHOD THAT IS ALREADY DEFINED IN ITS SUPERCLASS. The actual method to be executed is determined at runtime, based on the object's actual type.

---- 4.1.1. Use of @Override annotation ----

The `@Override` annotation is used to indicate that a method is intended to override a method in the superclass.  It's good practice to use this annotation to catch errors at compile time if you accidentally misspell the method name or have a different signature.

-- 4.2. Method Overloading (Compile-time Polymorphism) --

METHOD OVERLOADING OCCURS WHEN A CLASS HAS MULTIPLE METHODS WITH THE SAME NAME BUT DIFFERENT PARAMETER LISTS (different number of parameters, different types of parameters, or different order of parameters). The correct method to call is determined at compile time based on the arguments passed.

```java
class Animal {
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Generic animal sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override // Indicates that this method overrides the superclass method
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Woof!"); // Overriding the makeSound method
    }
}

class Calculator {
    public int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    public double add(double a, double b) { // Overloaded method
        return a + b;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal myAnimal = new Animal();
        Animal myDog = new Dog(); // Polymorphism: Treating a Dog as an Animal

        myAnimal.makeSound(); // Output: Generic animal sound
        myDog.makeSound(); // Output: Woof! (Runtime Polymorphism - Method Overriding)

        Calculator calculator = new Calculator();
        System.out.println(calculator.add(2, 3)); // Output: 5 (Compile-time Polymorphism - Method Overloading)
        System.out.println(calculator.add(2.5, 3.5)); // Output: 6.0
    }
}
```

*KEY TAKEAWAY:* Polymorphism enables treating objects of different classes in a uniform way. Method overriding occurs at runtime, while method overloading occurs at compile time.

= 5. Abstraction =

ABSTRACTION IS THE PROCESS OF HIDING COMPLEX IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS AND SHOWING ONLY THE ESSENTIAL INFORMATION TO THE USER. It focuses on *what* an object does rather than *how* it does it.

-- 5.1. Hiding Implementation Details --

ABSTRACTION ALLOWS YOU TO SIMPLIFY COMPLEX SYSTEMS BY HIDING UNNECESSARY DETAILS. For example, when you drive a car, you don't need to know how the engine works internally; you only need to know how to use the steering wheel, accelerator, and brakes.

-- 5.2. Abstract Classes --

AN ABSTRACT CLASS IS A CLASS THAT CANNOT BE INSTANTIATED DIRECTLY. It's designed to be a base class for other classes.  Abstract classes can contain abstract methods (methods without an implementation), which must be implemented by subclasses.

-- 5.3. Interfaces --

AN INTERFACE IS A COMPLETELY ABSTRACT "CLASS" THAT CONTAINS ONLY ABSTRACT METHODS (and constant variables, declared `static` and `final`).  All methods in an interface are implicitly `public` and `abstract`. Classes *implement* interfaces, providing implementations for all the methods declared in the interface.  A class can implement multiple interfaces.

-- 5.4. Abstract vs Interface --

| Feature         | Abstract Class                          | Interface                              |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Instantiation   | Cannot be instantiated directly        | Cannot be instantiated directly         |
| Methods         | Can have both abstract and concrete methods | All methods are abstract (implicitly public) |
| Inheritance      | Single inheritance only               | Multiple inheritance (implementation) |
| Variables       | Can have instance variables             | Can only have constant variables (static final) |
| `implements` or `extends` | `extends` | `implements` |

```java
abstract class Shape {
    abstract double getArea(); // Abstract method

    public void display() {
        System.out.println("This is a shape."); // Concrete method
    }
}

interface Drawable {
    void draw(); // Abstract method (implicitly public)
}

class Circle extends Shape implements Drawable {
    double radius;

    public Circle(double radius) {
        this.radius = radius;
    }

    @Override
    double getArea() {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }

    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a circle.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Circle myCircle = new Circle(5);
        myCircle.display();
        myCircle.draw();
        System.out.println("Area: " + myCircle.getArea());
    }
}
```

OUTPUT:

```
This is a shape.
Drawing a circle.
Area: 78.53981633974483
```

*KEY TAKEAWAY:* Abstraction simplifies complex systems by hiding implementation details. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated and can have abstract and concrete methods.  Interfaces define a contract that classes must adhere to.
