This lecture note aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) principles in the context of Java. We will cover the core concepts, their implementation in Java, and illustrate their application through examples.

-- Learning Objectives --

Upon completion of this lecture note, you should be able to:

* DEFINE the four core principles of OOP: Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.
* EXPLAIN how these principles are implemented in Java.
* DESIGN and IMPLEMENT Java classes utilizing these principles.
* APPLY OOP concepts to solve real-world programming problems.
* UNDERSTAND the benefits and drawbacks of OOP.

-- 1. Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) --

OOP is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object is defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.  It's about creating "objects" that contain both data and methods to manipulate that data.

* Benefits of OOP:
    * MODULARITY: Code is organized into reusable and independent objects.
    * REUSABILITY: Objects can be reused in different parts of the program or in other programs.
    * MAINTAINABILITY: Easier to modify and debug code due to its modular structure.
    * DATA HIDING:  Protects data from unauthorized access.
    * FLEXIBILITY:  Adapts well to changing requirements.

-- 2. Core OOP Principles --

2.1. Encapsulation:

Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (i.e., a class). It restricts direct access to the data and provides controlled access through methods.  This is also known as "data hiding".

* EXAMPLE (Java):

```java
public class BankAccount {
    private double balance; // Private variable, only accessible within the class

    public double getBalance() { // Public method to access the balance
        return balance;
    }

    public void deposit(double amount) { // Public method to modify the balance
        balance += amount;
    }
}
```

* KEY TAKEAWAY:  Encapsulation promotes data integrity and reduces unintended side effects.

2.2. Abstraction:

Abstraction is the process of hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the essential information to the user.  It simplifies the interaction with objects by presenting a high-level view.

* EXAMPLE: When you drive a car, you don't need to know the inner workings of the engine; you just need to know how to use the steering wheel, accelerator, and brakes.

* IMPLEMENTATION (Java): Achieved through abstract classes and interfaces.

```java
// Abstract class example
abstract class Shape {
    abstract double area(); // Abstract method (no implementation)
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    double radius;

    Circle(double radius) {
        this.radius = radius;
    }

    @Override
    double area() {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }
}

//Interface Example
interface Drawable{
    void draw();
}

class Rectangle implements Drawable{
    public void draw(){System.out.println("drawing rectangle");}
}
```

* KEY TAKEAWAY: Abstraction simplifies complex systems by hiding unnecessary details.

2.3. Inheritance:

Inheritance is the mechanism by which one class (subclass/child class) inherits the properties (data and methods) of another class (superclass/parent class).  It promotes code reusability and establishes an "is-a" relationship between classes.

* EXAMPLE: A `Dog` is a type of `Animal`.  The `Dog` class can inherit properties like `name` and `breed` from the `Animal` class.

* IMPLEMENTATION (Java): Uses the `extends` keyword.

```java
class Animal {
    String name;

    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("Animal is eating");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal { // Dog inherits from Animal
    public void bark() {
        System.out.println("Woof!");
    }
}
```

* KEY TAKEAWAY: Inheritance avoids code duplication and promotes code reusability and hierarchical classification.

2.4. Polymorphism:

Polymorphism means "many forms." It allows objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in their own specific way. There are two main types of polymorphism:

    * COMPILE-TIME Polymorphism (Method Overloading): Multiple methods with the same name but different parameters within the same class.

    * RUNTIME Polymorphism (Method Overriding): A subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass.

* EXAMPLE (Method Overloading):

```java
class Calculator {
    public int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    public double add(double a, double b) { // Overloaded method
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

* EXAMPLE (Method Overriding):

```java
class Animal {
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Generic animal sound");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    @Override
    public void makeSound() { // Overridden method
        System.out.println("Meow!");
    }
}
```

* KEY TAKEAWAY:  Polymorphism allows for flexible and extensible code that can handle different types of objects in a uniform way.

-- 3. Java Implementation of OOP Principles --

Java provides several features to support OOP principles:

* CLASSES:  The fundamental building block of OOP in Java. A class defines the blueprint for creating objects.
* OBJECTS: Instances of a class.
* METHODS: Functions that operate on the data of an object.
* ACCESS MODIFIERS: `public`, `private`, `protected`, and default (package-private) to control the visibility of class members and implement encapsulation.
* ABSTRACT CLASSES and INTERFACES: Used for abstraction and defining contracts.
* INHERITANCE: Achieved using the `extends` keyword.
* POLYMORPHISM:  Achieved through method overloading and method overriding.

-- 4. Real-World Case Study: A Simple E-Commerce System --

Consider a simplified e-commerce system:

* CLASSES: `Product`, `Customer`, `Order`, `ShoppingCart`.
* ENCAPSULATION: `Product` class could encapsulate `price` and `description` and provide methods to access them.
* ABSTRACTION: `PaymentGateway` interface could provide a simplified way to process payments, hiding the complexities of different payment processors.
* INHERITANCE: `ElectronicsProduct` and `ClothingProduct` could inherit from the `Product` class.
* POLYMORPHISM: A `calculateDiscount` method could behave differently for different types of products.

-- 5. Coding Challenges --

1.  CREATE a class `Shape` with an abstract method `getArea()`. Create subclasses `Circle` and `Rectangle` that implement this method.
2.  DESIGN a `Vehicle` class with properties like `speed` and `color`. Create subclasses `Car` and `Bike` that inherit from `Vehicle` and add their own specific properties and methods.
3.  IMPLEMENT a `Library` class that manages a collection of `Book` objects.  Implement methods to add books, remove books, and search for books.  Use encapsulation to protect the internal data of the `Book` class.

-- 6. Knowledge Consolidation --

* SECTION SUMMARY: We covered the core OOP principles (Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism) and their implementation in Java. We also explored a real-world case study to illustrate how these principles can be applied to solve practical problems.

* GLOSSARY OF KEY TERMS:

    * OBJECT: An instance of a class.
    * CLASS: A blueprint for creating objects.
    * ENCAPSULATION: Bundling data and methods together.
    * ABSTRACTION: Hiding complex implementation details.
    * INHERITANCE:  A mechanism for code reusability.
