Okay, here's a lecture outline and script based on the title "Java" and the single topic "OOPs".  I'll expand on OOPs, provide subtopics, examples, and interactive elements to make this a complete, engaging lecture.

## Lecture: Java - Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)

### Icebreaker (2 minutes)

"Alright, everyone, quick show of hands: How many of you have ever built something with LEGOs? Keep your hand up if you followed the instructions. Now, keep it up if you *didn't* follow the instructions and created something totally unique.  That's a little bit like OOP: using pre-built pieces (classes) to create your own unique applications."

### Core Content: Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) in Java (50 minutes)

**1. Introduction to OOPs (5 minutes)**

*   **Explanation:**
    *   Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm centered around "objects," which contain both data (attributes) and code (methods) to manipulate that data. It's a way to structure a program to model real-world entities. Think of it like designing a car: you don't just think about the individual parts, but how they all work together as a single *object* with properties (color, engine size) and behaviors (accelerating, braking).
    *   Java is fundamentally an object-oriented language.  While it has primitive data types, almost everything in Java revolves around objects. This makes Java code modular, reusable, and easier to maintain, especially in large projects. OOP promotes code reusability, reduces redundancy, and improves software maintainability.
*   **Subtopics:**
    *   Procedural vs. Object-Oriented Programming: Discuss the key differences.
    *   Advantages of OOP: Reusability, Modularity, Maintainability, Abstraction.
    *   Basic Concepts: Objects, Classes, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism.

*   **Real-time Example:**
    *   **Image Suggestion:** A visual diagram comparing procedural (spaghetti code) vs. OOP (well-organized modules).
    *   Think about online shopping.  Each product on Amazon is like an *object*. It has *attributes* (name, price, description, images) and *methods* (add to cart, buy now, view details). OOP allows the website to manage thousands of products efficiently.
    
*   **Question:** "Can anyone think of a real-world object and identify some of its attributes and behaviors?"

**2. Classes and Objects (10 minutes)**

*   **Explanation:**
    *   A **class** is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the *type* of object.  It specifies the attributes (data members or fields) and methods (functions) that objects of that class will have.  Think of a class as the architectural plan for a house.
    *   An **object** is an instance of a class.  It's the actual thing created from the blueprint. You can create multiple objects from a single class. Think of an object as the actual house built from the architectural plan. Each house might have different paint colors or furniture, but they all share the same basic structure defined by the blueprint.

*   **Subtopics:**
    *   Defining a Class: `class` keyword, data members (attributes/fields), methods.
    *   Creating Objects: `new` keyword, constructors.
    *   Accessing Object Members: Dot operator (`.`).

*   **Code Snippet:**
    ```java
    class Dog { // Class definition
        String breed; // Attribute
        String name;

        // Constructor
        public Dog(String breed, String name) {
            this.breed = breed;
            this.name = name;
        }

        void bark() { // Method
            System.out.println("Woof!");
        }
    }

    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Dog myDog = new Dog("Golden Retriever", "Buddy"); // Creating an object
            System.out.println(myDog.name + " is a " + myDog.breed); // Accessing attributes
            myDog.bark(); // Calling a method
        }
    }
    ```

*   **Real-time Example:**
    *   **Image Suggestion:** A diagram illustrating the relationship between a Class (e.g., "Car") and multiple Objects (e.g., "Red Sedan," "Blue SUV").
    *   Imagine a `BankAccount` class. Each person's bank account is an *object* of that class. They all have attributes like `accountNumber`, `balance`, and methods like `deposit()`, `withdraw()`.

*   **Question:** "What is the difference between a class and an object?  Give an analogy."

**3. Encapsulation (10 minutes)**

*   **Explanation:**
    *   Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods that operate on that data into a single unit, or "capsule."  It also involves hiding the internal implementation details of an object from the outside world and providing a public interface to interact with the object. This is achieved through access modifiers like `private`, `protected`, and `public`. The main goal is to protect the integrity of the data and prevent unintended modifications.
    *   Think of a vending machine. You can interact with it (insert money, select an item), but you don't need to know how the internal mechanisms work to get your snack.

*   **Subtopics:**
    *   Access Modifiers: `public`, `private`, `protected`, (and default/package-private).
    *   Getter and Setter Methods (Accessors and Mutators): Why they are important.
    *   Data Hiding: Protecting internal state.

*   **Code Snippet:**
    ```java
    class BankAccount {
        private double balance; // Private attribute

        public double getBalance() { // Getter method
            return balance;
        }

        public void deposit(double amount) { // Setter method (with validation)
            if (amount > 0) {
                balance += amount;
            }
        }
    }
    ```

*   **Real-time Example:**
    *   **Image Suggestion:** A diagram showing a class with private attributes and public getter/setter methods.
    *   Consider a car's engine.  You don't need to know exactly how the engine works internally to drive the car. You interact with it through the steering wheel, gas pedal, and brakes (the public interface).  Encapsulation hides the complex internal workings.

*   **Question:** "Why is encapsulation important for writing robust and maintainable code?"

**4. Inheritance (15 minutes)**

*   **Explanation:**
    *   Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class (the *subclass* or *child class*) to inherit properties and methods from another class (the *superclass* or *parent class*). This promotes code reuse and establishes an "is-a" relationship between classes. For example, a `Car` *is-a* `Vehicle`. The `Car` class can inherit properties like `numberOfWheels` and methods like `startEngine()` from the `Vehicle` class, and then add its own specific properties and methods (like `hasSunroof`).
    *   Inheritance creates a hierarchy of classes, making code more organized and easier to understand.

*   **Subtopics:**
    *   `extends` keyword.
    *   Superclass and Subclass.
    *   `super` keyword.
    *   Method Overriding.
    *   Types of Inheritance (Single, Multilevel, Hierarchical).  Java doesn't support multiple inheritance of classes.

*   **Code Snippet:**
    ```java
    class Vehicle { // Superclass
        String modelName;

        void startEngine() {
            System.out.println("Engine started");
        }
    }

    class Car extends Vehicle { // Subclass
        boolean hasSunroof;

        void openSunroof() {
            System.out.println("Sunroof opened");
        }
    }

    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Car myCar = new Car();
            myCar.modelName = "Sedan";
            myCar.startEngine(); // Inherited from Vehicle
            myCar.openSunroof(); // Car-specific method
        }
    }
    ```

*   **Real-time Example:**
    *   **Image Suggestion:** A class diagram showing a hierarchy of classes (e.g., Animal -> Mammal -> Dog -> Labrador).
    *   Consider different types of employees in a company.  You could have a base `Employee` class with attributes like `name` and `employeeID`.  Then, you could have subclasses like `Manager` and `SoftwareEngineer` that inherit from `Employee` and add their own specific attributes and methods (like `teamSize` for `Manager` or `programmingLanguage` for `SoftwareEngineer`).

*   **Question:** "Explain the 'is-a' relationship in the context of inheritance.  Give an example."

**5. Polymorphism (10 minutes)**

*   **Explanation:**
    *   Polymorphism means "many forms." In OOP, it refers to the ability of an object to take on many forms.  This is achieved through method overloading and method overriding.  It allows you to write code that can work with objects of different classes in a uniform way.
        *   **Method Overloading:** Defining multiple methods in the same class with the same name but different parameters (different number, types, or order of arguments).
        *   **Method Overriding:**  A subclass providing a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass.
    *   Polymorphism makes code more flexible and extensible.

*   **Subtopics:**
    *   Method Overloading (Compile-time polymorphism).
    *   Method Overriding (Runtime polymorphism).
    *   Dynamic Method Dispatch.
    *   Interfaces and Abstract Classes (as related to polymorphism).

*   **Code Snippet (Overloading):**
    ```java
    class Calculator {
        int add(int a, int b) {
            return a + b;
        }

        double add(double a, double b) {
            return a + b;
        }
    }
    ```

*   **Code Snippet (Overriding):**
    ```java
    class Animal {
        void makeSound() {
            System.out.println("Generic animal sound");
        }
    }

    class Dog extends Animal {
        @Override //Good practice to use @Override annotation
        void makeSound() {
            System.out.println("Woof!");
        }
    }

    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Animal myAnimal = new Animal();
            Dog myDog = new Dog();

            myAnimal.makeSound(); // Prints "Generic animal sound"
            myDog.makeSound();    // Prints "Woof!"
        }
    }
    ```

*   **Real-time Example:**
    *   **Image Suggestion:** A diagram illustrating how a single method call can result in different behavior depending on the object type.  Show a parent class "Shape" with subclasses "Circle," "Square," and "Triangle," each with its own implementation of a `draw()` method.
    *   Consider a `draw()` method in a graphics program.  The `draw()` method will behave differently depending on whether it's called on a `Circle` object, a `Square` object, or a `Triangle` object.

*   **Question:** "Explain the difference between method overloading and method overriding. Provide an example of each."
