#### 1. Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

**Explanation:**
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which contain data in the form of fields (also known as attributes or properties) and code in the form of procedures (also known as methods).  OOP focuses on creating reusable, modular, and maintainable code by modeling real-world entities and their interactions. Instead of writing code as a sequence of instructions, OOP structures code around objects that have both state (data) and behavior (methods). Java is an inherently object-oriented language, meaning that almost everything in Java is an object.

**Subtopics:**

*   **What is a Paradigm?**

    *   Explanation: A programming paradigm is a style or "way" of programming.  It's a fundamental approach to conceptualizing and organizing code.
    *   Examples: Imperative, Procedural, Functional, Declarative.
*   **Key Principles of OOP:**  Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction. (These will be covered in more detail later).
*   **Benefits of OOP:**
    *   Modularity: Code is organized into independent objects.
    *   Reusability: Objects can be reused in different parts of the program or in other programs.
    *   Maintainability: Changes to one object are less likely to affect other parts of the system.
    *   Abstraction: Complex systems can be modeled in a simplified way.
    *   Effective problem solving.

**Real-time Example:**
Think of a "Dog" object. It has properties like breed, age, color, and behaviors like bark, eat, sleep. OOP allows us to represent this in code.

#### 2. Core OOP Principles in Java

##### **A. Encapsulation**

**Explanation:**
Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods that operate on that data into a single unit, or "class," and restricting direct access to some of the object's components. This is achieved through access modifiers like `private`, `protected`, and `public`.  Encapsulation protects the integrity of the data by preventing uncontrolled access and modification. It promotes modularity and reduces the risk of unintended side effects.

**Subtopics:**

*   **Access Modifiers:**
    *   `private`: Accessible only within the class.
    *   `protected`: Accessible within the class, subclasses, and within the same package.
    *   `public`: Accessible from anywhere.
    *   `default` (no modifier): Accessible within the same package.
*   **Getters and Setters (Accessor and Mutator Methods):**  Methods used to access and modify private attributes.

**Real-time Example:**
A `BankAccount` class. The `balance` attribute is private. You can only access and modify it through `deposit()` and `withdraw()` methods, ensuring that the balance is never directly manipulated and stays consistent.

**Code Snippet:**

```java
public class BankAccount {
    private double balance;

    public BankAccount(double initialBalance) {
        this.balance = initialBalance;
    }

    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }

    public void deposit(double amount) {
        balance += amount;
    }

    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        if (amount <= balance) {
            balance -= amount;
        } else {
            System.out.println("Insufficient funds");
        }
    }
}
```

**Question:** "Why is it important to hide the internal state of an object?"

##### **B. Inheritance**

**Explanation:**
Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class (subclass or derived class) inherits properties and behaviors from an existing class (superclass or base class). This promotes code reuse and establishes an "is-a" relationship between classes.  Subclasses can extend the functionality of the superclass by adding new attributes and methods or overriding existing ones. Inheritance supports hierarchical classification and reduces code duplication.

**Subtopics:**

*   **`extends` Keyword:** Used to indicate inheritance in Java.
*   **Superclass and Subclass:** Parent and child classes.
*   **`super` Keyword:** Used to call the superclass constructor or access superclass members.
*   **Method Overriding:**  Providing a specific implementation of a method in the subclass that is already defined in the superclass.
*   **Types of Inheritance (Java supports single inheritance):**
    *   Single Inheritance: A class inherits from only one superclass.
    *   Multilevel Inheritance: A class inherits from a subclass, which in turn inherits from another class.
    *   Hierarchical Inheritance: Multiple subclasses inherit from a single superclass.
*   **Abstract Classes and Interfaces (related to inheritance and polymorphism):**  Will be covered later.

**Real-time Example:**
A `Vehicle` class (superclass) with attributes like `speed` and methods like `accelerate()`.  `Car` and `Bike` classes (subclasses) inherit from `Vehicle` and can add their own specific attributes (e.g., `numberOfDoors` for `Car`) and methods (e.g., `ringBell()` for `Bike`).

**Code Snippet:**

```java
class Vehicle {
    protected int speed;

    public void accelerate() {
        speed += 10;
        System.out.println("Vehicle accelerating. Speed: " + speed);
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    private int numberOfDoors;

    public Car(int numberOfDoors) {
        this.numberOfDoors = numberOfDoors;
    }

    public void openDoor() {
        System.out.println("Opening car door");
    }
}
```

**Question:** "What are the advantages of using inheritance? How does it promote code reuse?"

##### **C. Polymorphism**

**Explanation:**
Polymorphism means "many forms." In OOP, it refers to the ability of an object to take on many forms.  This is achieved through method overloading (compile-time polymorphism) and method overriding (run-time polymorphism). Polymorphism allows you to write generic code that can work with objects of different classes in a uniform way. It enhances flexibility and extensibility.

**Subtopics:**

*   **Method Overloading (Compile-time Polymorphism):**  Defining multiple methods in the same class with the same name but different parameters (different number, type, or order of parameters).
*   **Method Overriding (Run-time Polymorphism):**  Defining a method in a subclass that has the same name and parameters as a method in its superclass.
*   **Dynamic Method Dispatch:**  The process of selecting which method to execute at runtime based on the actual object type.
*   **Interfaces and Abstract Classes (used to achieve polymorphism):**
    *   *Abstract Class:* A class that cannot be instantiated and may contain abstract methods (methods without implementation).
    *   *Interface:* A completely abstract "class" that specifies a contract for classes to implement.  It contains only abstract methods and constant values.

**Real-time Example:**
A `Shape` class with a `draw()` method. Subclasses like `Circle`, `Square`, and `Triangle` override the `draw()` method to provide their specific drawing implementations.  A single `draw()` call can then draw different shapes depending on the object type.

**Code Snippet:**

```java
class Shape {
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a shape");
    }
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a circle");
    }
}

class Square extends Shape {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a square");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape shape1 = new Circle();
        Shape shape2 = new Square();

        shape1.draw(); // Output: Drawing a circle
        shape2.draw(); // Output: Drawing a square
    }
}
```

**Question:** "How does polymorphism make code more flexible and extensible?"

##### **D. Abstraction**

**Explanation:**
Abstraction is the process of hiding complex implementation details and exposing only essential information to the user.  It simplifies the view of an object or system by focusing on what it does rather than how it does it.  Abstract classes and interfaces are key tools for achieving abstraction in Java.  Abstraction allows you to create generalized models of real-world entities and reduces complexity.

**Subtopics:**

*   **Abstract Classes:**
    *   Cannot be instantiated.
    *   May contain abstract methods (methods without implementation).
    *   Subclasses must implement the abstract methods.
*   **Interfaces:**
    *   Completely abstract.
    *   Contain only abstract methods and constant values.
    *   Classes implement interfaces using the `implements` keyword.
*   **Hiding Implementation Details:**  Using access modifiers and carefully designing classes to expose only necessary functionality.

**Real-time Example:**
A `RemoteControl` class for a TV. You don't need to know how the TV works internally (the complex electronics). You only interact with the remote control to change channels, adjust volume, etc.

**Code Snippet (Illustrative):**

```java
interface Drawable {
    void draw(); // Abstract method
}

class Circle implements Drawable {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a circle");
    }
}

class Square implements Drawable {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a square");
    }
}
```
